  title={Open Science Recommendation Systems for Academic Libraries},
  author={Beltran, L., Griego, C., and Herckis, L.},
  abstract={An interdisciplinary academic team offers a comprehensive case study describing the development of a predictive model as the cornerstone for an open science recommendation system tailored to the Carnegie Mellon University community. This initiative will empower users in choosing open science services that align with their academic requirements, introduce academics to resources they find valuable, and bridge gaps within academic library service offerings.
  As an institution with a longstanding commitment to a science-informed approach and a focus on computer science, engineering, and artificial intelligence, Carnegie Mellon University has enthusiastically embraced open science practices. The Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Libraries has been instrumental in bringing these practices into our academic landscape.
  The authors strive to develop a predictive model which will evolve into a recommendation system. The pursuit of this endeavor has led the authors through several ethical considerations, such as data privacy, the involvement of student contributors, and the design of a persuasive recommendation system. We are committed to exploring ethical approaches for delivering user-centered recommendations and to preserving individual autonomy.
  The authors have actively engaged with diverse academic departments, students, and faculty, embarking on data exploration, and applying open science principles throughout the process. The resulting system will raise awareness of library services and deliver tailored recommendations for the adoption of proven research tools and practices.
  This case study serves as an exemplar of how universities can enact open science principles and develop systems that prioritize the user's interests, navigate institutional complexities to forge interdisciplinary collaboration, and muster resources to support innovative, multi-disciplinary efforts.},
